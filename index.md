##  Motivation

So why does the world need yet another architecture framework?

The honest answer is that it doesn't.

The website [EA Frameworks](https://www.enterprise-architecture.org/ea-frameworks/) lists over 900 Architecture Frameworks and although many of them are purpose specific variations of some common framework (TOGAF variants are popular) it's still an awful lot.

I even started one myself with Simon Watts (RIP) way back on the 2000's called "**Objective Architecture**" and wrote a quarterly column for TDAN called "_Architecture is Objective, Design is Subjective_" where I discussed various aspects of (mostly) Application Architecture and particularly Data Architecture.
It's always been my belief that all Application Architecture should be Objective based i.e. there must be a clearly defined reason for doing something with a clearly defined outcome for doing it.

I'm also firmly of the belief that Architecture should be driven by usable Models i.e. Models that can be directly implemented as part of a solution

In addition, with the emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and especially Agentic AI along with Generative AI (GenAI), I now think that the nature of Enterprise Architecture will fundamentally change along with these technologies.
Hence, we need to think about evolving an approach that incorporate these new technologies and optimise their benefits in a coherent way whilst minimising their risks and downsides.

Finally (and this is important) I'm also as lazy as hell and like to boil things down to a bare minimum and avoid doing unnecessary work by re-using existing models and artifacts wherever possible.

On that point it's worth bearing in mind that AI tools are very, very good at re-using existing content and artifacts to create new ones so if we can define a framework that encourages re-use then we can leverage AI tools to do a lot of the heavy lifting for us.
It's not a new invention but is an innovative way of thinking about how to apply existing ideas in a new context.

So, given all that, what will be found here is not an Architectural Framework _per se_ but lots of opinion about what an Architect should be doing and how they should be doing it based on 30+ years of designing and building many kinds of applications for many kinds of organizations for many kinds of business purposes.

Hopefully some of this is of use to someone else and if not then at least it will be of use to me as a reference for my own work.
